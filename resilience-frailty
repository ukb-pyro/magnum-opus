- Parameters
   - Informed by beliefs, updated recursively, unless thou art Orthodox
- Bayesian Prior Distribution
   - This is where bandwidth & context length from AI enhance human bandwidth
- Games Recursively Played
   - Collisions (Impact on Resilience/Frailty)
      - Adversarial
      - Transactional
      - Cooperative
- Splicing, Generativity, Hallucination
   - Depression, Bipolar, Schizophrenia
   - Might they have given sapiens an edge of other human species?
   - Charles Darwin has been proved in this space
      - Resiliency at birth (bequest); think of roots/trunk/fork/branching/canopy... to quantify in actual units from literature
         - Skin (quite resilient)
         - Bone
         - Muscle
         - Nervous 
         - Respiratory
         - Cardiovascular ("cardio" in variance-covariance dependency with recursively branching capillaries in tissues)
         - Liver (One of the more resilient ones)
         - GI System (Perhaps too resilient for its own good; hence high lifetime risk of colon cancer)
         - Reproductive system
           - Menopause as exhaustion (ie zero resilience of ovaries)
         - Etc..
       - Oncology (How all this is emergent)
         - Investigate dependencies 
           - Resilience
           - Lifetime risk of cancer 
           - Bad-Luck paper touches on this (Vogelstein & etc)
           - Internet says: how bad luck cancer paper was misreaeed by the press
        - Advantages and Disadvantages as "emergent" phenomena following recursive (adversarial, transactional [solid organ transplant like LDKT, DDKT], cooperative)
        - Survival (like Homo sapiens vs. all other Homo Whatever)
        - Mortality
        - Organ failure
   - Society is an emergent phenomenon
      - Crime & Punishment
      - Dostoevsky
      - Beyond Good & Evil
- Illusion of love, agency, madness, creativity, artistry, crime, punishment
   - Raphael's Perspectivism in School of Athens
   - Why does he use Michelangelo for Heraclitus?
   - And why is Heraclitus front and center? (Doesn't anyone even understand this?)
   - Diogenes??? Has no Apollonian apparell
   - Statues of Apollo and Athena truly cement this as perspectivism par excellence
   - Not to mention how his patrons may never have understood his work
